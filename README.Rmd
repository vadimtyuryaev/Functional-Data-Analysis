This repository provides a comprehensive exploration of Functional Data Analysis (FDA) 
which is a modern branch of statistics that models entire data trajectories as 
realizations of underlying functions, rather than as isolated multivariate points.
By shifting perspective from discrete observations to continuous functional objects,
FDA opens the door to more nuanced insights in fields ranging from biomedical
research and environmental science to finance and engineering.

Designed as both a learning resource and a practical toolkit, this repository is 
aimed at:
 
* Undergraduate and graduate students seeking an accessible entry point into FDA;

* Researchers who wish to incorporate FDA techniques into applied or theoretical
projects;

* Data science practitioners looking to move beyond traditional multivariate 
approaches and capture the dynamics of complex, high-dimensional data.

By visiting the website (`vadimtyuryaev.github.io/Functional-Data-Analysis/`) 
and actively engaging with the derivations and code, you will:
  
1. Grasp the **core concepts of FDA**, understanding how it differs from classical
statistics by treating observations as smooth functions residing in Hilbert spaces.

2. Learn the difference between **interpolation and smoothing**.

3. Explore **basis function expansions**, including detailed examples of what
**Fourier series** and **B-splines** are and how they are used to represent discrete 
data points as continuous curves.

4. Implement Functional Clustering, walking through an application of 
**Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC)** on the price curves of DJIA stocks
to identify market sectors.

5. Explore how two widely used numerical methods, **ODE solvers (RKF45) and Nonlinear Least Squares (NLS)**, 
operate at the algorithmic level.

6. Understand modern advances in parameter estimation such as **Generalized Profiling (GP)** 
for systems of nonlinear differential equations.
